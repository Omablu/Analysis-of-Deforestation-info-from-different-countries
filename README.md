# Analysis-of-Deforestation-info-from-different-countries
This project was completed using 3 Deforestation datasets comprising of the Regions, Land areas and Forest areas.
All three datasets was used to generate insights and answer the following questions;

# Questions and Insights to be generated
* Find the total number of countries involved in deforestation. 
* Show the income groups of countries having total area ranging from 75,000 to 150,000?
* Retrieve the names of countries that have a forest area (in square kilometers) greater than the average forest area of all countries in the "High Income" income group.
* Calculate the average total area (in square miles) for countries in the "Upper Middle Income" income group? 
* Compare the result with the rest of the income categories... Hint: calculate average total areas for the 3 other categories
* Determine the total forest area (in square kilometers) for countries in the "High Income" income group? Also compare with the other income categories. 
* What are the countries from each region or continent having the highest total forest area?

  To start, I created a database names Deforestation_Analysis and loaded the three datasets into the Sql server
Regions Dataset
