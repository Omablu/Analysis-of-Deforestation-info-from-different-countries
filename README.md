# Analysis-of-Deforestation-info-from-different-countries
This project was completed using 3 Deforestation datasets comprising the Regions, Land areas, and Forest areas.
All three datasets were used to generate insights and answer the following questions;

# Questions and Insights to be generated
* Find the total number of countries involved in deforestation. 
* Show the income groups of countries having total area ranging from 75,000 to 150,000.
* Retrieve the names of countries with a forest area (in square kilometers) greater than the average forest area of all countries in the "High Income" income group.
* Calculate the average total area (in square miles) for countries in the "Upper Middle Income" income group. 
* Compare the result with the rest of the income categories... Hint: Calculate the average total areas for the 3 other categories
* Determine the total forest area (in square kilometers) for countries in the "High Income" income group. Also, compare with the other income categories. 
* What countries from each region or continent have the highest total forest area?


  To start, I created a database named Deforestation_Analysis and loaded the three datasets into the SQL server
Regions Dataset
